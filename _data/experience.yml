    I worked as a researcher in HASAT project done in collaboration with HAVELSAN and ASELSAN, leading defense and security corporations in Turkey.
    The project aimed to create an application that is capable of detecting various types of targets from satellite and aerial images. 
    I developed computational models for change, hot object, road, water and water related targets (rivers, dams, bridges) detection.
