      Each year, TU Delft organises a free-to-attend event which transforms its campus into a huge stage for technology, 
      innovation and music. In 2015, this event was named as 'A day of Wonder'. During a Ted-X like session where multiple 
      talks by researchers are followed by an innovative musical performance, we collected data using smart badges. 
      The aim of this experiment was to train machine learning models that can predict the experience of the audience, 
      similar to the Lucent Dance Theater experiment. The main difference between these two experiments was the structure and 
      characteristics of the events. A day of Wonder had a more chaotic flow where participants can sit, 
      stand and move freely during the event. Our results have shown that the model we proposed was still successful in predicting 
      experience, even in these harder conditions.
