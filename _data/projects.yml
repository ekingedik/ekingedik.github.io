      Together with social scientists from Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, we organised three speed dating events 
      on three seperate days, in a pub. Each day, 16 participants from each sex participated in 3 minutes of speed dates.
      Speed dates are then followed by a free mingling session approximately lasting one hour. These events were captured 
      with cameras and personal smart badges. I have analysed this large dataset of approximately 90 people using machine 
      learning techniques and investigated different concepts such as detection of social actions, identification of conversing groups 
      and estimation of participants personality traits. My current research focuses on combining these elements for the analysis of participants'
      experience and romantic attraction.

      We teamed up with scientists from Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica and designed an in-the-wild experiment for analysing the 
      experience of the audience in a dance performance. Audience members wore smart badges that recorded their subtle movements 
      throughout the event. Using the joint movement of audience members, we were able to predict audience members' experiences 
      of the event, in terms of their enjoyment and immersion. We also found out that parts where participants moved in synchrony 
      corresponded to salient moments of the performance. With this study, we provided an alternative way of evaluating the success 
      of an event, rather than traditional methods like questionnaires or interviews.

      Each year, TU Delft organises a free-to-attend event which transforms its campus into a huge stage for technology, 
      innovation and music. In 2015, this event was named as 'A day of Wonder'. During a Ted-X like session where multiple 
      talks by researchers are followed by an innovative musical performance, we collected data using smart badges. 
      The aim of this experiment was to train machine learning models that can predict the experience of the audience, 
      similar to the Lucent Dance Theater experiment. The main difference between these two experiments was the structure and 
      characteristics of the events. A day of Wonder had a more chaotic flow where participants can sit, 
      stand and move freely during the event. Our results have shown that the model we proposed was still successful in predicting 
      experience, even in these harder conditions.

      Cohesion is known to be a key component in the success of professional teams. Together with IBM Center for Advanced Studies Benelux, 
      we investigated ways of automatically measuring cohesion through wearable sensing. With smart badges 
      that records body acceleration, we have recorded real meetings of IBM teams. The privacy preserving nature 
      of the badges made non-obstrusive solutions possible. We analysed the individual actions and interactions 
      of team members through recorded data and developed computational models that can connect these information to cohesion.
