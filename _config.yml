  I am a computer scientist that aims to detect, analyse and enhance social experiences with the help of <mark>wearable sensing</mark> and <mark>machine learning</mark>.
  My expertise lies in automatic analysis of individual social behaviour, group interactions and how these concepts connect to the general social experience. 
  I currently hold a post-doctoral researcher position in [Socially Perceptive Computing Lab](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/socially-perceptive-computing-lab/) of TU Delft.

  My research interests span variety of topics in applied machine learning and social science. Here's a short list\:
    - Time-series data 
    - Social signal processing
    - Affective computing
    - Computational behavioral science
    - Individual and group behaviour
    - Human activity detection
    - Domain adaptation and transfer learning

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.
