  I am a computer scientist that aims to detect, analyse and enhance social experiences with the help of wearable sensing and machine learning. My expertise lies in automatic analysis of individual social behaviour, group interactions and how these concepts connect to the general social experience. I currently hold a post-doctoral researcher position in Socially Perceptive Computing Lab of TU Delft.
